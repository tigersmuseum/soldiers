We have information about soldiers from multiple sources. Sources generate records that name a soldier and provide some source-specific information. We need to aggregate information from all sources to create a biographical record for each soldier. The first problem is identifying when different records are about the same soldier. We need an authoritative record with correct spelling of names, correct service numbers (the soldier may have had more than one), and correct birth and death dates (if available). This is the *soldiers* database. It will have a single record for each individual.

We can compare make rank and number from sources against the soldiers database and make the best match. We assign each source record the authoritative soldier ID.
