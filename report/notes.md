We have information about soldiers from multiple sources. Sources generate records that name a soldier and provide some source-specific information. We need to aggregate information from all sources to create a biographical record for each soldier. The first problem is identifying when different records are about the same soldier. We need an authoritative record with correct spelling of names, correct service numbers (the soldier may have had more than one), and correct birth and death dates (if available).
