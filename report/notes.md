We have information about soldiers from multiple sources. Sources generate records that name a soldier and provide some source-specific information. We need to aggregate information from all sources to create a biographical record for each soldier. The first problem is identifying when different records are about the same soldier. We need an authoritative record with correct spelling of names, correct service numbers (the soldier may have had more than one), and correct birth and death dates (if available). This is the *soldiers* database. It will have a single record for each individual.

We can compare name rank and number from sources against the soldiers database and make the best match. We assign each source record the authoritative soldier ID. There is possibility for error here. We deem the soldiers database to be authoritative but that does not make is necessarily correct, since it is itself built from sources that may contain errors.

Source records can be matched against the database for close matches as well as exact matches. This means that source records with transcriptions errors can still be matched. It also means that the database entry can be corrected if necessary. Matching records from a new source against the database may also serve a quality check on the database.

There is a trade-off between completeness and correctness when compiling the soldiers database. If there is consistent information about a soldier from multiple sources then we can be confident the database entry is correct. Information from any single source may be subject to transcription errors - and if that information is partial (surname but no initials say) then it will be more likely to give spurious matches.

We transform information from any one source so a Soldiers XML file. We run a program that compares each **person** entry in this file against the database. This adds a **candidate** element for each match. The result is zero or more candidate matches for each **person**. We can then filter the results: If there is only one candidate, and the match is sufficiently close, we give the soldier that identity. If there are multiple candidates, then the best can be selected - which may involve further investigation of the source material and/or the database. If there are no candidates then the soldier is currently unknown, and can be added to the database. We may want to repeat this identification process if the database changes.

The output from the above matching and filtering process is a Soldiers XML file where each **person** entry has a *@sid* attribute set to the relevant Soldier ID from the database. If we do this for multiple sources, we end up with file for each with **person** entries that can be linked by Soldier ID.

We can *collect* the entries for a single soldier from all sources into a single XML file. The name and number entries for an individual person may vary across the sources (because we allow for transcription errors in the matching); so it is name, rank and number details from the database that are used in the merged output. Each source will have source-specific information inside a **note** element, and these notes are collected together so that the output has just one entry per person, and this entry has information from all sources.

Soldiers XML can be XSL transformed to make a biographical report.
