# Mentions

The relational database is name, rank and number.
Other information that a source might provide can be captured in Soldiers XML as bespoke *note* elements, but is not stored in the database.
Having used the database to identify a soldier, we want to know what sources have  further information. We add a [MENTIONS](../mentions/README.md) table to the database for this purpose.
