# schema

## Relational schema
Here are relational database schema for **Microsoft Access** and **Apache Derby**.

## XML schema
Here also is an XML schema definition (XSD) for **Soldiers XML**. The format is designed to constrain the information used in the database (names, dates and service records), but also includes a *notes* element that will allow ad hoc notes to be attached to each *person* element.

The aim is to produce an XML document that can be used add data to a *soldiers* database or publish information from it. At the same time, the format can be used to capture records about soldiers from any source; with name rank and number captured formally, and any ancillary information
capture as *notes*.
